# Data Management and Historical Data Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Data Management Buttons in Settings Page

**Problem**: User reported that "add sample data" and "clear data" buttons were not visible in the settings page.

**Root Cause**: The data management section was hidden by default and only visible to users with admin role. The user might not have been logged in as an admin.

**Solution**: 
- ✅ Verified that an admin user exists in the system
- ✅ Confirmed the data management buttons are properly implemented
- ✅ Verified the role-based visibility logic works correctly

**Admin Credentials**:
- Username: `admin`
- Role: `admin` 
- Status: Active

### 2. Historical Data Page Showing Filler Data

**Problem**: The historical data page was displaying hardcoded placeholder values instead of real analytics data.

**Root Cause**: The page was using static HTML values and mock JavaScript functions instead of calling the actual analytics APIs.

**Solution**: ✅ Complete rewrite of the historical data page to:
- Load real data from `/api/analytics/summary` and `/api/analytics/traffic` endpoints
- Update statistics cards with actual visitor counts, dwell times, peak hours, and conversion rates
- Create dynamic charts using real data from the database
- Implement proper error handling and loading states
- Add support for different time ranges (1h, 6h, 24h, 7d, 30d)

## How to Access Data Management Features

### Step 1: Login as Admin
1. Go to the login page
2. Use credentials:
   - **Username**: `admin`
   - **Password**: `Admin123!` (change this after first login!)

### Step 2: Access Settings Page
1. Navigate to Settings from the main menu
2. Look for the "Customer Data Management" section
3. If you're logged in as admin, you'll see:
   - **Add Sample Data** button (green)
   - **Clear Customer Data** button (red)

### Step 3: Use Data Management Features

**Add Sample Data**:
- Creates 7 days of realistic sample customer data
- Includes demographics, traffic patterns, and detection records
- Useful for testing and demonstrating analytics functionality
- Clears existing data before adding new sample data

**Clear Customer Data**:
- Permanently removes all demographic information
- Keeps detection records and system logs intact
- Requires double confirmation for safety
- Cannot be undone

## Technical Details

### Database Methods Available
- `populate_sample_data()` - Creates comprehensive sample data
- `clear_demographics_data()` - Removes all demographic records
- `get_analytics_summary()` - Provides real-time analytics
- `get_hourly_traffic()` - Returns traffic data over time

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/populate-sample-data` - Add sample data (admin only)
- `POST /api/clear-demographics` - Clear data (admin only)
- `GET /api/analytics/summary?hours=24` - Get analytics summary
- `GET /api/analytics/traffic?hours=24` - Get traffic data

### Security Features
- Admin-only access for data management operations
- Double confirmation dialogs for destructive operations
- Role-based visibility controls
- Session-based authentication

## Testing Instructions

1. **Login as Admin**: Use the credentials provided above
2. **Test Data Management**: 
   - Try "Add Sample Data" to populate the database
   - Check that Historical Data page now shows real data
   - Try "Clear Customer Data" to test data removal
3. **Test Historical Data**:
   - Navigate to Historical Data page
   - Verify statistics show real numbers (not filler data)
   - Try different time ranges (1h, 6h, 24h, etc.)
   - Check that charts update with real data

## Known Limitations

- Path analysis section still shows placeholder (no path tracking implemented yet)
- Custom date range picker is present but uses default time ranges
- Weekly aggregation uses simple algorithm (could be improved)

## Next Steps

If you need to:
- **Change admin password**: Use the user settings page after login
- **Create additional admin users**: Use the registration page with admin role
- **Add more sample data**: Run the "Add Sample Data" operation multiple times
- **Reset everything**: Use "Clear Customer Data" then "Add Sample Data"

The system is now fully functional with proper data management capabilities and real analytics data display!
